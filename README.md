This WordPress plugin adds multi-tiered flat rate shipping option for the 
WooCommerce plugin.

== Description ==

WordPress administrative users can create a multi-tiered flat rate shipping fee 
based on the total number of items in a WooCommerce cart. The store 
administrator can choose to apply this shipping method to all available 
countries that the store may ship to, or only specific countries.

There are four tiers, one for each USPS flat-rate box in this shipping method,
And a fifth tier that is additive to the fourth tier, with a per-item flat rate
for additional items beyond what fits in the fourth tier.

This plugin is most useful to those that use USPS flat rate boxes and ship
items that are fairly inform in size such that the number of items per box can
be estimated up front.  Clothing resellers, for example, may find this plugin
useful.

1. Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation and activate the plugin.

2. Go to the "Shipping" tab on the WooCommerce Settings page in the WP admin.

3. Click on "Tiered Shipping" in the "Shipping Methods" table to enable this 
shipping method and update its settings.
